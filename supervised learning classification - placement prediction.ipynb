    "The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regression, the output variable of Classification is a category, not a value, such as \"Green or Blue\", \"fruit or animal\", etc. Since the Classification algorithm is a Supervised learning technique, hence it takes labeled input data, which means it contains input with the corresponding output.\n",

    "The likelihood that a student will be hired by a firm may be predicted using placement prediction utilizing machine learning techniques. The application of machine learning algorithms offers a more data-driven and objective approach to the hiring process, allowing businesses to find potential applicants who would have gone unnoticed using conventional hiring techniques. Machine learning is becoming more and more prevalent across a wide range of sectors, and placement prediction using machine learning algorithms is poised to become a crucial tool in the hiring process."
